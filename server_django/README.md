<h3>Note that for now, the server does not have an interface and thus running it is pointless.  Soon it will be integrated with the android application.</h3>

<h2>Website Appendix / Setup Instructions</h2>

These instructions are here in order to allow you to setup your django installation and development environment on a virtualenv, which essentially isolates a python installation as well as the included packages (django, etc) so that other python installations cannot interfere with this install, and we have a solid base to work on.

NOTE: make sure that once you go through all of these directions, you only interact with the django project from within the virtualenv.  This is explained further down, but just remember: 'workon kinderUpdate'


NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE:
<h3>----- AMAZON EC2 RUNNING SERVER INSTANCE ----------</h3>

We currently have an amazon ec2 server running the newest version of the site.  

You can access this website by going here: -- NOT AVAILABLE YET --

Any and all testing is equivalent for this version as well as the django local servers below.  You don't really need to follow these directions, just go to the link above.

In order to login to the site, use the following credentials:
